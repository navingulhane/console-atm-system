# Mini ATM System (C)

A console-based ATM simulator developed in C that replicates basic banking operations such as authentication, deposits, withdrawals, and transaction tracking.  
This project focuses on strengthening core programming fundamentals and problem-solving skills through a real-world system simulation.

## Features

- Secure PIN authentication (3 attempts limit)
- Balance inquiry
- Cash deposit
- Cash withdrawal
- Change PIN functionality
- Mini statement (last 5 transactions)
- Menu-driven console interface

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Conditional statements (if-else, switch)
- Loops
- Arrays
- Circular buffer logic
- Structured programming
- User input handling

## How to Compile and Run

### GCC

### Any IDE
Compile and run `main.c`.

## Project Structure


## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a simple yet practical system to understand how ATM software works internally while improving programming logic and code structure.

## Future Improvements

- File handling for persistent balance storage
- Password masking
- Multiple user accounts
- Modular function-based architecture
- Enhanced security features
